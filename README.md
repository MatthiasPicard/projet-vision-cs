# projet-vision-cs

## Description

This project is a computer vision project that aims to detect and recognize the letter of the alphabet that a person is giving using sign language. The project is divided into two parts: the first part is the detection of the hand and the second part is the recognition of the letter. The project is implemented using Python and OpenCV.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7
- OpenCV
- Numpy

## Run the project

To run the project, you need to run the following command:

```bash
python realtime.py
```

This will open the webcam. You will see two windows: one with the full original image and the other with the hand cropped and with the skin color detected. To exit the program, you need to press the `q` key.
